""" Wrapper for piglit executables

This imports functions from the framework and calls them with the argument
parts that the parser defined here doesn't konw how to parse.

It is very important that the final parser not generate a help message
(add_help=False in the constructor arguments), otherwise this parser will
capture -h/--help and the results will not be useful.

# Setting sys.path is actually pretty complicated, since there are three
# seperate uses we need to detect:
# 1) piglit is being run in the source directory, built in tree
# 2) piglit is being run from the source directory outside of it, built in tree
# 3) piglit has been built out of tree and installed, and is being run in or
#    out of the install directory

# Case one is the implicit case. In this event nothing needs to be set, it
# should "just work" (tm)

# It is critical that this block be run before importing anything from
# framework (as there is no gaurantee that framework will be in python's path
# before this blck is run)
